# For this project, I downloaded California Traffic Collision data (.csv) from Kaggle and explored the data using the following queries in SQLite.

--what was the primary violation for a fatal accident?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pcf_violation) AS "total_occurences", pcf_violation_category
FROM switrs.collisions
WHERE collision_severity = 'fatal'
GROUP BY pcf_violation_category
ORDER BY total_occurences DESC;

--of those collisions that were fatal, what is the average age of the victim?
SELECT AVG(victim_age)
FROM switrs.victims 
WHERE victim_degree_of_injury = 'killed'
AND victim_age IS NOT NULL;
